# Monkey Typer Game

I have recreated the **Monkey Typer** game using **C++** and the **SFML** library. Additionally, I used **Adobe Photoshop** to design a unique and engaging user interface.

## Game Description

In this game, your goal is to **type words before they reach the right side of the screen**. Words appear from the **left** and move towards the **right**, varying in:

- **Speed**
- **Size**
- **Color**
- **Position**

-> Typing the word correctly before it exits the screen earns you points.

## Features

- Custom **UI design** made with Adobe Photoshop
- Adjustable **font** and **difficulty** settings
- Dynamic word behavior and movement
- Created with **C++** and **SFML**
